# CollabSync : AI Developer  & Chat for Teams
once, I attended a hackathon, communication and collaboration were typical issues between me and my team. Whenever we were stuck on an issue, we used to take the advice of AI models. But they used to provide varying responses to the same query, which consumed a lot of our time. We later realized that this was because we were providing different inputs to different team members and therefore obtaining varying results. We also experimented with various solutions on different machines, which was clumsy and even more time-consuming.

To counteract this challenge, I created CollabSync â€” a collaboration chat team app with a native AI agent. It enables real-time communication and effortless collaboration. The AI agent also helps with task management, increasing productivity and efficiency.

The app is still under development, so it requires some polish to be completed, but the core features are already live.
